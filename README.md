This a repository for my personal [Gatsby](www.gatsbyjs.org) website. It was originally based on the [Gatsby Starter Default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) starter, but has been heavily modified. Feel free to fork/copy whatever you need out of here!

The dark/light mode feature was taken from [this](https://joshwcomeau.com/gatsby/dark-mode/) excellent blog post by Josh W. Comeau.

The 404 page idea was taken from [here](https://sld.codes/articles/Rethinking-404-Pages). I thought it was pretty clever, and it was pretty easy to implement.

The content for this blog is posted in a [submodule](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) that is stored in a [separate repository](https://github.com/cbadger85/charles-badger-blog-content). If you see anything incorrect or poorly spelled in a blog post, feel free to make a pull request!
