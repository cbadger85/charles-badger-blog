I'm a full-stack software engineer whose passionate about learning new technologies. I love to learn through small (or sometimes not small) coding experiments. I thought a blog would be a good way to document some of those experiments.

## Tech I'm into right now =>

- JavaScript
- Typescript
- React
- Node
- Kotlin
- Ktor
